# Cloud Run Deployment with GitHub Actions

This repository automates the deployment of applications to Google Cloud Run using GitHub Actions. By leveraging this workflow, you can streamline the process of deploying your application to different environments like development, staging, and production.

## How It Works

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The deployment process is controlled by GitHub Actions workflows defined in YAML files. These workflows specify the steps to be executed when certain events occur, such as pushing code to specific branches.

### Pipeline Configuration

The `pipeline.yaml` file defines deployment jobs for different branches:

- **Development (dev):** Deploys changes to the `develop` branch to a development environment.
- **Staging (stage):** Deploys changes to the `stage` branch to a staging environment.
- **Production (prod):** Deploys changes to the `prod` branch to a production environment.

### Deployment Workflow

The `deployment.yml` file orchestrates the deployment process:

1. **Checkout:** Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
2. **Authenticate to Google Cloud:** Authenticates the workflow to interact with Google Cloud Platform services.
3. **Set up Cloud SDK:** Configures the Google Cloud SDK on the runner.
4. **Docker Authentication:** Configures Docker authentication to push container images to Google Artifact Registry.
5. **Build and Push Container Image:** Builds the Docker image for the application and pushes it to the Artifact Registry.
6. **Render Templated Config Manifests:** Generates configuration manifests for Cloud Deploy based on templates.
7. **Create Cloud Deploy Delivery Pipeline:** Applies the Cloud Deploy configuration to create a delivery pipeline.
8. **Create Release Name:** Generates a unique name for the release.
9. **Create Cloud Deploy Release:** Creates a release in Cloud Deploy with the specified configuration.
10. **Report Cloud Deploy Release:** Provides details about the created release.

### Secrets

Certain sensitive information, such as service account keys, are stored as secrets in the GitHub repository. These secrets are securely passed to the deployment workflow, ensuring secure authentication and authorization with Google Cloud Platform services.

## Getting Started

To start using this deployment workflow for your own projects:

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access Google Cloud Platform services.
2. Configure the required secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
3. Customize the deployment YAML files (`pipeline.yaml` and `deployment.yml`) to match your project's requirements.
4. Push your code changes to the appropriate branches to trigger the deployment workflow.
